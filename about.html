                <h3>What is Young Folk's Tennis?</h3>
                <p>Winston-Salem Tennis began this program over 35 years ago to introduce the game of tennis to
                    youngsters in our community! It is close to a year round program offering free, one hour clinces on
                    Saturday mornings at various facilities in our area. These clinics are taught by top, professional
                    pros in the Winston-Salem community.

                    The Quickstart format is used to teach Young Folks Tennis. What is Quickstart? This is a new USTA
                    format for kids ages 8 and under and 10 and under. Quickstart Tennis is an exciting new play format
                    for learning tennis, designed to bring kids into the game by utilizing specialized equipment,
                    shorter court dimensions and modified scoring, all tailored to age and size. It is divided into two
                    different levels - ages 8 and under and ages 10 and under. It's the fast, fun way to get kids into
                    tennis and keep them playing!
